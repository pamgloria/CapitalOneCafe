# Capital One Cafe
Capital One Cafe is a landing page for one of my favorite neighborhood cafes that I greatly enjoy going to. I wanted to create a site that has the same atmosphere as the actual cafe.
Consits of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

## Work in progress
I would like to incorporate a menu page in which visitors can preview items on the menu before going, as well as an about us page that shows who the staff(baristas/utility/superviser/managers) are.
